## Even Fibonacci Numbers

### Description 

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Analysis and Solution

Notice that the sequence is by

O (for odd), E (for even), O, O, E, O, O, E,...

So we just need to add the $3k+2$ term. Gernearlly, we perform dynamic programming to solve iteration problems.

```python
def get_nth_Fibonacci(n):
    if n==1 or n==2:
        return 1
    else:
        return get_nth_Fibonacci(n-1) + get_nth_Fibonacci(n-2)       
```

However, this method is not good enough, because we don't need to get each term, and it will cost much if we perform program above in a for loop.

In this case, we add the numer while generating Fibonacci numbers, so we could optimize our program.

```python
result = 0
num1 = 0
num2 = 1
next_number = num2  
count = 1

while next_number<4*10**6:
    if count&1 == 0:
        result += next_number

    count += 1
    num1, num2 = num2, next_number
    next_number = num1 + num2

print(result)
```

And the result is `4613732`.
